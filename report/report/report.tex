    \section{Overview}
    
    \texttt{EPower} provides electricity for a small country from six power sources: gas, coal, nuclear, wind, hydro and an interconnect. We aim to help plan for a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and cope with variability of demand and wind, with the objective of maximizing \texttt{EPower}'s total profit whilst satisfying power demand.

    Power output is measured in Megawatts (MW). Electricity (energy) generated is power output over a period of time: it is equal to ``power" $\times$ ``time" and is measured in Megawatt hours (MWh). The selling price of electricity is \textsterling 35/MWh. Table \ref{Table 2} in the Appendix summarizes the output and costs of each of the six power sources. Also shown are the carbon dioxide and sulphur emissions, measured in standardized units per MWh of electricity generated from that power source. \texttt{EPower} must not exceed the daily limits of these two pollutants, which are given in Table \ref{Table 3} in the Appendix.
       
    \section{Base Case - The Current Situation}
	
    To investigate the two additional dimensions that we aim to plan for, we first look at the base case\textemdash that is, the current decisions of \texttt{EPower}. Table \ref{Table 1} below shows the amount of electricity to generate for each source in each period. By adhering to this optimal generation scheme, \texttt{EPower} will make a total daily profit of \textsterling 2.034 million.

    	\caption{Electricity generated for each source in each period\label{Table 1}}
    \end{table}
    
    In summary, the max output for most power sources should never be reached. The exceptions are: wind power, which should always operate at its average maximum output; and hydro power, which should operate at its maximum output during the fourth period (4pm-8pm) only. The running and increase costs for wind power are extremely low, so it is always advantageous to maximize electricity generation from this cheap source of power. Demand is highest during the evening, which requires hydro power to be at its capacity during those hours since this power source offers the second-best running and increase costs. In times of low demand, water should be pumped into the reservoir to replenish water levels.
    
    It is important that electricity generation using nuclear power is constant. The increase cost of nuclear power is extremely large so any variation in its usage would incur heavy losses. Similarly, electricity generation using gas power should be relatively constant (except for during the first period (12am-6am)). Since the interconnect has the highest running cost of all power sources, \texttt{EPower} should not purchase any power from this source at all.
    
    Based on our observations of \texttt{EPower}'s current situation, we would recommend:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Finding ways of expanding maximum output of wind power\textemdash by investing in more wind turbines.
    \item Reducing nuclear power usage, possibly by increasing the maximum output of wind, gas and coal power.
    \item Investing in gas and coal power to make them less polluting, thus making it easier to comply with emissions standards and to prepare for further limits in the future.
    \end{itemize}
