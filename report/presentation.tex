              \begin{itemize}

                  \item The best outcome arises from adding the 1 GW to wind capacity, closely followed by nuclear.
                  
                  \pause

                  \item In either case, losses are approximately halved to \textsterling 1.4 million.

                \begin{itemize}

                      \item A greater increase in capacity is required, but where and how much?  Our analysis shows:
                      
                      \pause
                      
                        \item A 2.5 GW investment in either wind or nuclear output capacity would return operations to a small profit of approximately \textsterling 200,000-300,000.

\item However, this trend does not continue for both.

	\pause

\item \textbf{A 4 GW expansion of wind capacity would restore profit to current levels}.

\item A 4 GW expansion of Nuclear will not yield the same outcome, due to the increased running costs of nuclear power.

%\item Investment in the capacity of other sources is not generally worthwhile.

                \begin{itemize}

                    \item Reduce variability of demand throughout the day using incentives for consumers.

                    \item Invest in additional capacity to reduce reliance on expensive sources:
                    
                    \begin{itemize}

                        \item Hydro output may also be worthwhile.

                \end{itemize}
        
        	\item Reduced CO\textsubscript{2} limits:

                \begin{itemize}

                    \item Add approximately 4000 MW to wind power max capacity
                    
                    \item Other considerations: emission credits market, carbon tax.  Technology to clean the output of `dirty' and cheap sources like coal.

                \end{itemize}
        
        	\item Key takeaway: \textbf{a significant investment in wind capacity would be beneficial} in both scenarios considered.
