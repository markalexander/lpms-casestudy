                \begin{itemize}

                \end{itemize}

            	\begin{itemize}
                	
                    \item Hydro reservoir serves a similar overflow function as the interconnect but is much cheaper.
                    
                    \item Here, between 1600 and 2000, hydro is being fully utilized and the marginal value of additional capacity is \textsterling 45.

                \item  Better approach: \textbf{simulate effect on profit} using \textit{distributions} of wind and demand inputs \note[item]{ to obtain a generalized optimal policy}.

                \item Best approach: \textbf{adapt dynamically to changing conditions} throughout the day.  May not be suitable for some sources.  \note[item]{Not all sources can adapt dynamically.  How to decide nuclear output is critical.}

                \begin{itemize}

                      \item A greater increase in capacity is required, but where and how much?  Our analysis shows:

\item However, this trend does not continue for both.

	\pause

\item \textbf{A 4 GW expansion of wind capacity would restore profit to current levels}.

\item A 4 GW expansion of Nuclear will not yield the same outcome, due to the increased running costs of nuclear power.

                \begin{itemize}

                    \item Reduce variability of demand throughout the day using incentives for consumers.

                    \item Invest in additional capacity to reduce reliance on expensive sources:

                \end{itemize}
        
        	\item Reduced CO\textsubscript{2} limits:

                \begin{itemize}

                    \item Add approximately 4000 MW to wind power max capacity
                    
                    \item Other considerations: emission credits market, carbon tax.  Technology to clean the output of `dirty' and cheap sources like coal.

                \end{itemize}
        
        	\item Key takeaway: \textbf{a significant investment in wind capacity would be beneficial} in both scenarios considered.
